        <p class="part1_chapter1">Janetta was the music governess—a brown little thing of no particular importance, and
            Margaret Adair was a beauty and an heiress, and the only daughter of people who
            thought themselves very distinguished indeed; so that the two had not, you might think,
            very much in common, and were not likely to be attracted one to the other. Yet, in spite
            of differing circumstances, they were close friends and allies; and had been such ever
            since they were together at the same fashionable school where Miss Adair was the petted
            favorite of all, and Janetta Colwyn was the pupil-teacher in the shabbiest of frocks, who
            got all the snubbing and did most of the hard work. And great offence was given in
            several directions by Miss Adair's attachment to poor little Janetta</p>
                
            
            
            <p class="part2_chapter1">"It is an unsuitable friendship," Miss Polehampton, the principal of the school, observed
            on more than one occasion, "and I am sure I do not know how Lady Caroline will like
                it."</p>





        <p class="part3_chapter1">Lady Caroline was, of course, Margaret Adair's mamma.
            Miss Polehampton felt her responsibility so keenly in the matter that at last she resolved
            to speak "very seriously" to her dear Margaret. She always talked of "her dear
            Margaret," Janetta used to say, when she was going to make herself particularly
            disagreeable. For "her dear Margaret" was the pet pupil, the show pupil of the
            establishment: her air of perfect breeding gave distinction, Miss Polehampton thought,
            to the whole school; and her refinement, her exemplary behavior, her industry, and her
            talent formed the theme of many a lecture to less accomplished and less decorous pupils.
            For, contrary to all conventional expectations, Margaret Adair was not stupid, although
            she was beautiful and well-behaved. She was an exceedingly intelligent girl; she had an
            aptitude for several arts and accomplishments, and she was remarkable for the delicacy
            of her taste and the exquisite discrimination of which she sometimes showed herself
            capable. At the same time she was not as clever—("not as glaringly clever," a friend of
            hers once expressed it)—as little Janetta Colwyn, whose nimble wits gathered
            knowledge as a bee collects honey under the most unfavorable circumstances. Janetta
            had to learn her lessons when the other girls had gone to bed, in a little room under the
            roof; a room which was like an ice-house in winter and an oven in summer; she was
            never able to be in time for her classes, and she often missed them altogether; but, in
            spite of these disadvantages, she generally proved herself the most advanced pupil in
            her division, and if pupil-teachers had been allowed to take prizes, would have carried
            off every first prize in the school. This, to be sure, was not allowed. It would not have
            been "the thing" for the little governess-pupil to take away the prizes from the girls
            whose parents paid between two and three hundred a year for their tuition (the fees were
            high, because Miss Polehampton's school was so exceedingly fashionable); therefore,
            Janetta's marks were not counted, and her exercises were put aside and did not come
            into competition with those of the other girls, and it was generally understood amongst
            the teachers that, if you wished to stand well with Miss Polehampton, it would be better
            not to praise Miss Colwyn, but rather to put forward the merits of some charming Lady
            Mary or Honorable Adeliza, and leave Janetta in the obscurity from which (according
            to Miss Polehampton) she was fated never to emerge. </p>





        <p class="part4_chapter1">Unfortunately for the purposes of the mistress of the school, Janetta was rather a favorite
            with the girls. She was not adored, like Margaret; she was not looked up to and
            respected, as was the Honorable Edith Gore; she was nobody's pet, as the little Ladies
            Blanche and Rose Amberley had been ever since they set foot in the school; but she was
            everybody's friend and comrade, the recipient of everybody's confidences, the sharer in
            everybody's joys or woes. The fact was that Janetta had the inestimable gift of
            sympathy; she understood the difficulties of people around her better than many women
            of twice her age would have done; and she was so bright and sunny-tempered and
            quickwitted that her very presence in a room was enough to dispel gloom and ill-temper.
            She was, therefore, deservedly popular, and did more to keep up the character of Miss
            Polehampton's school for comfort and cheerfulness than Miss Polehampton herself was
            ever likely to be aware. And the girl most devoted to Janetta was Margaret Adair. </p>
        

            <p class="part5_chapter1">
                "Remain for a few moments, Margaret; I wish to speak to you," said Miss Polehampton,
                majestically, when one evening, directly after prayers, the show pupil advanced to bid
                her teachers good-night. 
            </p>
            <p class="part6_chapter1">
                The girls all sat round the room on wooden chairs, and Miss Polehampton occupied a
high-backed, cushioned seat at a centre table while she read the portion of Scripture
with which the day's work concluded. Near her sat the governesses, English, French and
German, with little Janetta bringing up the rear in the draughtiest place and the most
uncomfortable chair. After prayers, Miss Polehampton and the teachers rose, and their
pupils came to bid them good-night, offering hand and cheek to each in turn. There was
always a great deal of kissing to be got through on these occasions. Miss Polehampton
blandly insisted on kissing all her thirty pupils every evening; it made them feel more
as if they were at home, she used to say; and her example was, of course, followed by
the teachers and the girls.
            </p>
            <p class="part7_chapter1">
                Margaret Adair, as one of the oldest and tallest girls in the school, generally came
forward first for that evening salute. When Miss Polehampton made the observation just
recorded, she stepped back to a position beside her teacher's chair in the demure attitude
of a well-behaved schoolgirl—hands crossed over the wrists, feet in position, head and
shoulders carefully erect, and eyes gently lowered towards the carpet. Thus standing,
she was yet perfectly well aware that Janetta Colwyn gave her an odd, impish little look
of mingled fun and anxiety behind Miss Polehampton's back; for it was generally known
that a lecture was impending when one of the girls was detained after prayers, and it
was very unusual for Margaret to be lectured! Miss Adair did not, however, look
discomposed. A momentary smile flitted across her face at Janetta's tiny grimace, but it
was instantly succeeded by the look of simple gravity becoming to the occasion
